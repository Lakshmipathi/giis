	* Release of giis 4.6
	What's up doc?
			-Code optimized for giis installation. It reduces 5% of installation time:)

To accomplish this, changes made to,

giis.conf 		- New config value called LEVEL_VALUE is added.
init.c			- converts LEVEL_VALUE config value from ascii to int.
file.c			- read_config_file() reads the LEVEL_VALUE value from config file.

				 -Automatic update.
				 -Eliminate repeations.
				 
To accomplish this changes made to,

* dir.c		: update_dir global variable is implemented for updation of directories.

* main.c	: Command line options are implemented for giis.Thus user interaction
		  is little better.	
		  
* searchnupdate.c : check4file_dups()- update files and update only files which are modified or created since last update. 
		  Other files which are ignored.
		  check4dir_dups()- This records any new directories that are with the  LEVEL_VALUE range.

	* Release of giis 2.0
	
		What's new?
				- Capable of supporting files more than 8.04MB.
				- New and Effective storage technique.
	
To accomplish these Changes made to,
	

* giis.h         : Structure plus union of big_file_recover_info and  bigger_file_recover_info both are removed.
		   Members such as sindirect_block_hole[],dindirect_block_hole[]
		   are also removed from s_file_recover_info.since hole concept implemented 
		   in giis1 to save space is no longer needed since we use new storage method
		   which takes care of space utilization. 	 
		   New members such as is_offset,id_offset introduced to keep record of 
		   how many entries are in sind and dind file.
		   Global variable s_offy and d_offy plays vital roles in recovery.
		   These two keep track of offset in sind and dind files.

	
* dir.c		 : Modifications are made to the ways we store file or directory details.We
		   get rid of the process of storing files and directory simultaneously and record only directory details first
		   then record files details from above said directory with a help new global variable called install_file.
		   Though storing file and directories provides high speedy opertion i believe
		   Reliablity is much more important than speed. 		 	 	 
	 	   
* file.c	 : Since new storage method is implemented we can't read block by block
		   with fixed size from sind and dind files.Since each record is of variable size.
		   so use s_offy and d_offy along with s_offset and d_offset for  fragmented files.	
	
* searchnupdate.c: search4sequence12() and search4sequence13() both totally revamped  to introduce a new storage method for file     				   recovery.search4sequence13() now can get details of files upto 4GB size.avoid_dups() and call2remove() are 
		   implemented to avoid repeation of entries during installtion.
				  
				 
* get_it_i_say.c : Changes to get_it_i_say() for retrival is necessary  since new  storage technique is 		   implemented in searchnupdate. And error check for size is implemented.And we check                           whether the last data block during recovery matches original last data block of                              file.force_giis() is added to recover a given file.eye_on_gd() to  keep track of group                       numbers.
