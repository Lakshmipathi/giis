<p>
Read this Enhanced giis-Implementation and overview part only after giis_overview_implementation.Since here we deal with only changes made to its previous version.
Near 60% of giis remains as it was.The foundation remains the same (like inode,
group Descriptor etc) and changes made to the way of search,store and recover the files.<br>
So read <a href="giis.html">giis_overview_implementation</a>
before this.

</p>

O.k<br><p>
 
Now you read that doc part.<br>
<u>Limitations of giis1:</u><br>
<pre>
*Only files upto 8.04 MB can be recovered.
*Even when you update,LEVEL_VALUE taken into account. 
*Duplicates files  are available LEVEL_VALUE no.of times.
</pre>
<u>Advantages of giis2:</u><br>
<pre>
*files More than 8.04 MB can be recovered. 
*LEVEL_VALUE limitation is eliminated. 
*Specific file can be retrieved.
*Efficient storage mgmt.
*Duplication is avoided.
*Tested for bugs quite a long period.
</pre>



In giis1 we used a concept called holes.Just to recall we used holes (sindirect_block_hole[],dindirect_block_hole[])to avoid wastage of space when we deal with files greater than 48KB
and slightly fragmented-less than  five holes. <br>
<u>Disadvantages of holes:</u><br>
*Thus for all files less than 48KB or non-fragmented files we still wasted 80 bytes. 
(since sindirect_block_hole[10],dindirect_block_hole[10] are not used).<br>
*If  files has more than 5 holes then  we use sind or dind files with a fixed record size
(1024 entries to hold blocks.)
Say we have 24 holes then we use files to store these values the remaining 1000 are wasted.
(4000 bytes)An substaincial amount of memory space wasted.<br>
So inorder to avoid wastage of space.We introduce variable record size.Thus first record
may be of  100 bytes and next might use 1000 bytes.
The major problem that arise when we use variable sized record is that we can't use 
random access like fixed records.<br>

<p>


So here we implementing some kind of index-sequentital  access method for retrival.

Before looking at what's newly introduced in giis2.Let's have a quick look at what are all  removed from giis1.
</p>
<pre>

* Following structures are removed, 
		struct s_big_file_recover_info
		struct s_bigger_file_recover_info.

* Following members of struct s_file_recover_info are removed,
	 	unsigned long   sindirect_block_hole[10]; /* Single Indirect Block */	
	 	unsigned long   dindirect_block_hole[10]; /* Double indirect Block */



What's introduced,

* New members of struct s_file_recover_info,
		unsigned long   is_offset; /* Total no.of Single Indirect Blocks   */	
	 	unsigned long   id_offset; /* Total no.of double indirect blocks   */	
	 	unsigned long   last_data_block;/* Block number where last data stored */

* Global variables,
		install_file		-- used to denote when to store files informations.
		unsigned long s_offy	-- Keeps track of sind file offset during retrival. 
		unsigned long d_offy	-- Keeps track of dind file offset during retrival.

* New procedures,
		avoid_dups() - Used to make an directory entry invalid if it's already recorded.
		call2remove(int) - This is helper function to above one.
		force_giis()	-Recovers the requested  file.
		eye_on_gd()	-Keep track of group numbers.

</pre>
<p>
First let's take up dir.c,<br>
In show_dir() we first record directory entries  alone with the help of install_file.
After recording directories we start to record files when install_file is set by search4dir()
in searchnupdate.c<br>
In  record_file() we do some raw error checks and store last_data_block which is used by
the file.<br>
We get rid of the process of storing files and directory simultaneously and record only directory details first then record files details.<br>
Though storing file and directories provides speedy opertion there are  duplicate entries recorded in the process since i believe Reliablity is much more important than speed.<br>
In search4dir() note the usage of install and install_file.We just record directories 
record_dir() and update it with update_dir_info_file() and removes duplicates by 
calling avoid_dups() and then record files.So that we don't have repeatation of data.
This is differs from  giis1 whereas in giis1 we store dir and files simultaneously  
so there is repeatation of data.By eliminating repeatation we made LEVEL_VALUE limitation
absoultely irrevelant so set LEVEL_VALUE to maximum limit say 12.
This is possible only because of elimination of duplicate entries in DIR file.<br><br>

<u>Test for efficiency:</u><br>
<pre>
giis2 LEVEL_VALUE=12 occupies 462.1KB
In giis1 with LEVEL_VALUE=12,
A whopping 117.6MB(Yes it's MB)
That's a hugeeee memory.  
</pre>

I believe avoid_dups() codes might be not so efficient but it's different. 
The codes of avoid_dups() and call2remove() is given below,

<pre>
/*	 
* Introduced for giis2:
* avoid_dups():Called Only during installtion 
* This is used to figureout whether we have any duplication of directory entry.

int avoid_dups(){
int fp1,fp2,i,record_no,bity;
unsigned long temp,end;
	
	fp1=open(DIR_INFO_FILE,0);	
	if(fp1==-1){

		}
	fp2=open(DIR_INFO_FILE,0);	
	if(fp2==-1){
		perror("open:");
		printf("\nError No:%d",errno);
		close(fp1);
		return -1;
		}

	/* Not so elegant code/method to check 4 repeatation 
	 but i think...it's different */
	 
	end=lseek(fp1,0,2);	/* EOF */
	lseek(fp1,0,0);
	
	temp=bity=0;
	while(temp<(end-GIIS_DSIZE)){
		i=read(fp1,giis_d.buffer,GIIS_DSIZE);
		if(i!=GIIS_DSIZE){
			perror("read1()");
			printf("\nError No:%d \t fp=%d",errno,fp1);
			close(fp1);
			return -1;
		}
		temp+=GIIS_DSIZE;
		
		/* Read next record in fp2 from current record of fp1 */

		lseek(fp2,lseek(fp1,0,1),0);
		

		while(i>0){
		
	       	i=read(fp2,giis_dt.buffer,GIIS_DSIZE);
	       	
		 
		if((giis_d.info.inode_number==giis_dt.info.inode_number)&&(giis_dt.info.search_flag==1)){
		
			/* Get the duplicate record number */
			
			record_no=lseek(fp2,0,1)/GIIS_DSIZE;	

			call2remove(record_no);
			}
		}
	}
close(fp1);
close(fp2);
return 1;
}
/*
* Introduced for giis2:
* call2remove()- This removes a directory entry from future processing by just resetting its 
* search flag to zero.
* This is helper funtion to avoid_dups().
*/
int call2remove(int record_no)
{
int fdes,i;
	fdes=open(DIR_INFO_FILE,2);
		if(fdes==-1){
			perror("open");
			return -1;

	 giis_dt.info.search_flag=0;

<u>Implementing variable sized records:</u><br>
In file.c,Since we use variable size records for sind and dind files use s_offy and d_offy along with s_offset and d_offset for reading these files.<br>
</p>
search4sequence12() and search4sequence13() both totally revamped to introduce variable
sized records.<br>
Note:  we scan though blocks and record only holes and nothing else in file.<br>
<u>How we record file details:</u><br>
Say for example,
a file "human" with some holes (ie) blocks not in sequence we 
just record these blocks in sind and dind file in {this_block,that_block} format.
Which means when we reach this_block we have to jump to block number given by that_block. 
if human has 5 holes in single indirect then s_offset=10 and
2 holes double indirect blocks d_offset=4,Since it's a pair.<br><br>
We are recording only {this_block,that_block} format values and not any index like inode_number
in sind or dind.So We have nothing otherthan {this_block,that_block} in sind and dind files.
Rememeber only non-sequential blocks are entered in files and all sequential blocks are 
not recorded at all.

<pre>
Coding of search4sequence12() is given below,

int search4sequence12(){
unsigned long indirect_block[1024],prev;		
int i,hole,fp,count;
count=hole=0;		
	lseek64(fd,(unsigned long long )giis_f.info.data_block[12]*fs.block_size,0); 
	read(fd,indirect_block,fs.block_size);
	
			/* Check 4 holes */
	if(indirect_block[0]-giis_f.info.data_block[12]!=1){
		idata_block[count++]=giis_f.info.data_block[12];
		idata_block[count++]=indirect_block[0];
		hole++;
	}
	
prev=indirect_block[0];
for(i=1;i<1024 && indirect_block[i] ;i++){

		if(indirect_block[i]-prev==1){
			prev=indirect_block[i];
			continue;
			}
		
		else{		/* hole uses {this_block,that_block} format */
			idata_block[count++]=prev;
			idata_block[count++]=indirect_block[i];
			hole++;
			prev=indirect_block[i];
		}

}

		/* Update is_offset and sfragment_flag and last_data_block */

					perror("Open:");
					printf("Error no :%d",errno);
					return -1;
				}
	lseek(fp,0,2);	
	i=write(fp,idata_block,count*sizeof(unsigned long));
		if(i!=count*sizeof(unsigned long)){
			perror("write");

			return -1;
			}
	close(fp);
	return 1;
	}

return 1;

Code search4sequence13():<br>
search4sequence13() is exactly same as search4sequence12() but use two lseek() and two read()
since it's double indirect to access data.
<a href="Kick_start.html"> How to access files Using Double indirect</a>
Here to access files more than 8.04MB we use recursive call to search4sequence13().
During recursive call we have make sure that we do access correct data blocks with
a help of static prev variable and global round.Just before exit record the last data
block for future error check while recover.

<u>How index-sequential access implemented in giis2:</u><br>
<pre>
A file named "human" with,
s_offset=10, thus it has 5 holes or 10 entries ( block numbers )in sind file.
d_offset=4 , thus it has 2 holes or 4 entries in dind file.
Assume human is the first record.
Then in order to access them,
just read first 10 entries from sind and first 4 entries from dind and Make Jump when needed.

Now we have another file named "space" with, 
s_offset=2, thus it has 1 hole or 2 entries in sind file.
d_offset=54 , thus it has 27 holes 54 entries in dind file.
Assume "space" is the second record.
Then we can't open and read first 2 entries from sind and first 54 from dind,
we have to skip entries of previous record (human).
Here is  where s_offy and d_offy plays a vital role.
s_offy used to record the sum of all previous records s_offset.
d_offy used to record the sum of all previous records d_offset.

So here s_offy=10 and d_offy=4
move to record of "space" by using,
lseek(fp,10*sizeof(unsigned long),0)	- in sind file.
lseek(fp,4*sizeof(unsigned long),0)	- in dind file.

Now read 2 entries from sind file and 54 entries from dind file.

Say we have a third file called "universe" which uses only sind file and not dind.

Say it's s_offset=2;
s_offy=12.Remember s_offy is sum of all previous records s_offset.
d_offy=4 since d_offset=0;
</pre>
Rule is to update s_offy and d_offy whenever you want to access {this_block,that_block}
from sind and dind file.<br><br>

I thought about using a direct index(just store offset of each record)in s_file_recover_info for each records instead of updating s_offy and d_offy.
since giis must go though all files sequentiallty to verify it's deleted or not i opted 
to update s_offy and d_offy instead of using a permanent seperate index/address in struct.
<br>
<u>How to compute/access single or double indirect blocks:</u><br>
<pre>
* In giis2 we have following flags for single indirect,
* sfragment_flag=0 files not uses single indirect at all.
* sfragment_flag=1 file uses single indirect but it's already in sequence.
* sfragment_flag=2 file uses single indirect with SIND FILE .
</pre>
<p>
Since we know the access mechanism used EXT3 we compute those blocks on our own.
Note : A single indirect can have maximum of 1024 blocks.
If s_fragmentflag=1 then since it's in sequence we just increment block numbers 1024 times.
If s_fragmentflag=2 then we keep incrementing until we met this_block given by sind file
{this_block,that_block} and jump to that_block.Then keep on incrementing until we reach
next this_block or maximum block limit of single indirect.<br>
Note the usage of both s_offy and is_offset.<br>
<u>Dual role:</u><br>
<pre>
s_offset  plays two vital roles.
One when we sum up all previous s_offset,we get offset in SIND file.
Secondly use s_offset alone will gives the total entries of this record.
Similarly,
d_offset also plays two vital roles.
Sum up all previous d_offset to get to offset in DIND file.
Use d_offset alone for total no.of entries of this record.
This is the reason why we don't used any index for SIND/DIND.
We used s_offset and d_offset as an address as well as a counting variable.
</pre>
In double indirect accessing ,Be careful about when to jump espeically
when is at entry 1023.Here  d_offy and id_offset plays an vital role.

And force_giis() is introduced to recover a requested file alone.Code for 
force_giis() is quite  simple and please refer get_it_i_say.c file.

That's it.These are the major modifications made to giis.
Rest of giis is pretty much the same as previous one.
I guess giis is simple and when bugs arise put them into the box.
And my inbox is &lt;lakshmipathi_g@rediffmail.com&gt;

Just a second,i found a major bug in search4sequence13(),
Here is  final few lines in search4sequence13()

			
	if(i==1024 && indirect_block[1023]!=0 && indirect_block[i]!=0){
				prev=indirect_block[1023];
				round=1;
				search4sequence13();
	
				}
return 1;
}
Can you figure it out! Yes we used recursive function.
Note that i'm  are concentrated only on recursively  scanning through blocks and 
just return.But not on how to return from all recursive functions which might be called.
So redefined code as,

				ret=search4sequence13();
				if(ret==444)
				return 1;
				
				}
				

return 444;	/* Will be caught by recursive function */
}

But still can't last_data_block correctly,
the problem is with if(cond),
So the correct final few part of code is,

	if(i==1024 && indirect_block[1023]!=0){
				prev=indirect_block[1023];
				round++;
				ret=search4sequence13();
				if(ret==444)
				return 1;
				
				}
				

return 444;	/* Will be caught by recursive function */
}

					The En..
</pre>
<u> A Big <strike>BUG</strike> Breakthrough:</u>
<p>
Just wait,before that some big files are not access by giis-2 i thought it's might be because of internal usage
of fragments by GNU/Linux.But unsure about this since i heard that fragments are not yet implemented.
So decided to just leave those things.As a one last attempt to find out the
real hickup,first i copied Group descriptor which has no.of free blocks and inodes in all groups.<br>
Then i copied a file of size say 300 MB,Once again copied GD and while 
comparing these old and new GD i found blocks count decreased in more than one GD.
So here since the data is large it can't be hold in single GD it's scattered around GD.
And so far we accessing small files thus mostly blocks from single GD.When it comes 
to large files we need to access more than one GD.<br>
How to access data block from Next GD.?<br>
So tried to set group number for each data block to my suprise it's works.
we keep on eye on Group number by eye_on_gd().
</p>
So i'll quickly end this document before finding any more bugs.
