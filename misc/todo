Bug:WHY/How following file contents is read by giis as metadata during giis -i?

Fix:Till now ,i think it read symbolic link & assumes accessing valid data reads
first blk content(unforunately first blk is not 0) :) 
which leads to a bug in giis.
Better skip these symbolic links ( file type 7)

Bug:raw Error  check
	returning 3 ---typo lol ....it's not 49512 it's 49152.

2PM@Aug 22 2008

BUG:why sometimes tooooooo many files opened by giis??????????

Fix:iin.in.i_block[0] == iin.in.i_block[1]

Above error check in dir.c returns without closing opened file.
You  can wonder when this happen ,
when a file is empty it true both blks has same address which is 0 :)

I need to re-examine this part.

Is it possible to recover mysql db with giis? 

YES.........it works :-) :-) ;-)

giis did recover deleted mysql table

check the same with specific mysql-db
check the same with mysql itself ;-)


--------------
bug:Why parent name of file is not reflected correctly?

Found:
It's because ,
".." will give parent of current directory "."
i think i made mistake,
for files too giis took ".." as parent instead of "."
Need to fix this bug:

--------------
sep 5 @815am:
recover and restore -Fill the struct with values and use it if user requested this option.
(file.c,get_it_i_say.c,giis.h)


Save system directories too not just system files(check dir.c for more)

What giis will do if we have same filename under different directory?
?????????????---Use inode for search and recovery rather than file name


-------------
 mv /giis/got_it/lol /root
if move successful then creat soft link
ln -s /root/lol /giis/got_it/lol
--------------
wait instead of doing above simply creat hardlink at restore path :)

------------
User defined --LEVEL_VALUE????????
-----------------
Why&how duplicate files are recorded?--need to fix---yes.done

ya this did the trick ...check4file_dups (parent_original);...instead of this i was digging something for
days.lol:)
-----------
finding end of directory--need to fix.
entry is not setting to zero when ever u get 
name = . and type =2 and rec_len=1--wow...once again hair pulling for more than few days didn't work...
after a relaxing for 8 hr or so ...got it with in first 20 mints.:)

----------------

enable giis for large directories ..greater than 4kb ---todo next release

oct-2:@11.53am
large_dir support of given - provided the blocks are in seq.
unlink restore file.

-------------

#lsr-
#supports just direct blocks --No -may be separate tool

++++++++++++++++
(i_uid,i_mode,i_atime,i_ctime,i_gid)
changed from int to short int

	gid_t             mode;			  /* File type */
	uid_t             owner;		  	  /* owner's uid */	



jan -4-2009 @9.30pm
UI- Path 
/etc/giis.conf file for tuning 
giis.conf should have device name,directories and update time setup.


jan-11@1.35am
added read_config_file() to file.c
dir.c invokes above fun. 
To fix:
(giis.conf file included during install...but during giis -u)
read_conf_file_inum () - added in file.c to get&update flag in DIR_INFO_FILE
in searchnupdate.c,new global variable new_dir_added  is used to updated new directory's sub-directory during update
fix:int read_dir_info_file () -- stupid use tfd not fd :(


Almost ready for giis4.4 ;)

------
if 
#include <linux/ext3_fs.h> 
not present then only:
#include "ext3_fs.h"

--------------------------------
