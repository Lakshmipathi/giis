Note-0:/etc/giis.conf is the configuration file.For more info. please refer configuration file setup below.

Note-1:If your machine has earlier giis versions (<=4.2),please uninstall it and freshly install giis.

Note-2:By default,giis updates every 20 mintues,if you want to adjust this setting then edit both in /etc/crontab file and /etc/giis.conf file.

Installing Binary :
===================

To install giis binary just follow the steps:

1) Change giis directory  

	cd giis_XX (Replace XX with appropriate version number for example giis_4.3)

2) Run the shell script named 'install_giis.sh',

	For interactive installation use:

	sh install_giis.sh 0
	
	For non-interactive ,config file installation ,(more info see "Configuration File Setup" below)

	sh install_giis.sh 1
	

Installing giis from Source Code :
==================================

To compile and install giis from source code just follow the steps:

1) Change to source directory.

	giis_XX/src(Replace XX with appropriate version number,for example giis_4.3)

2) Run the configure script,

	./configure

3) Compile the programs,

	make

4) Install the programs,

	make install

5) Now Run giis -i.

6) Finally run following commands,
 	cp ../config/hai /giis
	cp ../config/quotes /giis
	cp ../config/giis.conf /etc

Configuration File Setup:
=========================
config/giis.conf should be edited before running giis installation with config file using command,
sh install_giis.sh 1
It will place the file under /etc.


During installation, giis will prompt user for directories that needs to be protected.
After installation user can't configure(add) any new directories.
To overcome this limitation,/etc/giis.conf file allows user to configure directories
(after installation)list that can be protected.


During installation ,if auto-detection of device fails you can enter device name directly  in $DEVICE macro.
Example:
$DEVICE = /dev/sdaX$

Replce X with your device number.Please make sure there is blank space/whitespace before and after = symbol.
The line should have $ symbol at beginning and at the end.

You can add directories using $DIR macro.Again Please make sure there is blank space/whitespace before and after = symbol.Here too line
should start and end with $ symbol.

These directory *must* be direct sub-directory of /,while /etc is allowed entry and /etc/something is not allowed

Valid Examples:

$DIR = etc$
$DIR = var$
$DIR = opt$

Invliad options:
$DIR=etc$ 		-- Invalid since there should be whitespace before and after =.
$DEVICE=/dev/sda2$	-- Invalid since there should be white space before and after =.
DIR = etc 		-- Invalid since there should be $ symbol at the beginning and end of line.
$DIR = etc      	-- Invalid since there should be $ at the end of the line.
$DIR = etc $		-- Invalid since there whitespace space before $

I hope above examples helped you.In simple terms ,
1)There MUST BE single whitespace before and after = 
2)There SHOULD NOT BE any whitespace before or after $.


$LEVEL_VALUE ,used to provide Max.Directory depth.Default value Supports upto 10 levels of sub-dir.(dir1/dir2/dir3.../dir10)
